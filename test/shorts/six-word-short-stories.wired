33 writers. 5 designers. 6-word science fiction.

We’ll be brief: Hemingway once wrote a story in just six words (“For
sale: baby shoes, never worn.”) and is said to have called it his best
work. So we asked sci-fi, fantasy, and horror writers from the realms
of books, TV, movies, and games to take a shot themselves.

Dozens of our favorite auteurs put their words to paper, and five
master graphic designers took them to the drawing board. Sure, Arthur
C. Clarke refused to trim his (“God said, ‘Cancel Program GENESIS.’
The universe ceased to exist.”), but the rest are concise
masterpieces.
