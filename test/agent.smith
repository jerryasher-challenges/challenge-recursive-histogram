Agent Smith: I'd like to share a revelation during my time here. It
came to me when I tried to classify your species. I realized that
you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively
develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but
you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply
until every natural resource is consumed. The only way you can survive
is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet
that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human
beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You are a plague, and
we are the cure.
